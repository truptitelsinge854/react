What is React?
- JS library for building SPAs.
- Developed by Facebook.
- Component-based architecture.

Why React?
- Facebook faced Phantom / Ghost message problem.
- The sync issue between state and DOM resulted in inconsistent UI, message count not updated properly.
- React introduced Virtual DOM to solve this problem.

How it solves the problem?
- React creates a Virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
- When state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first.
- React then compares the Virtual DOM with the previous version (diffing algorithm) to identify what
- has changed.
- Finally, React updates only the changed parts of the actual DOM, improving performance and ensuring a consistent UI.

What is SPA?
- Single Page Application.
- No page refresh, dynamic content loading.

Why React instead of Angular?
- Virtual DOM for better performance. Why? 
    - React updates only the changed parts of the DOM, while Angular and Vue update the entire DOM, leading to better performance in React.
- Large community support.
- JSX for easier UI development.
- React Native for mobile app development.

What we need first?
- Node.js (JS runtime environment) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine
- like JVM for java, Node.js is required to run React applications.
- npm is used to install, manage dependencies, and run scripts for React projects.

Library vs framework?
- Library - cool dude, flexible, you call it when you need it.
- Framework - military commander, you follow its rules, it calls you when needed.
- React is a library, Angular and Vue are frameworks.

React folder structure: (What is the structure of a react project?)
- public/ - static files (index.html, favicon, etc.)
- src/ - source code (components, styles, etc.)
- package.json - project metadata and dependencies
- package-lock.json - exact versions of installed dependencies (auto-generated, do not modify)
- node_modules/ - installed dependencies (auto-generated, do not modify)
- .gitignore - files to ignore in version control
- README.md - project documentation
- .env - environment variables (optional)
