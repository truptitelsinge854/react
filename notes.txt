What is React?
    - JS library for building SPAs.
    - Developed by Facebook.
    - Component-based architecture.

Why React?
- Facebook faced Phantom / Ghost message problem.
- The sync issue between state and DOM resulted in inconsistent UI, message count not updated properly.
- React introduced Virtual DOM to solve this problem.

How it solves the problem?
- React creates a Virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
- When state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first.
- React then compares the Virtual DOM with the previous version (diffing algorithm) to identify what
- has changed.
- Finally, React updates only the changed parts of the actual DOM, improving performance and ensuring a consistent UI.

What is SPA?
- Single Page Application.
- No page refresh, dynamic content loading.

Why React instead of Angular?
- Virtual DOM for better performance. Why? 
    - React updates only the changed parts of the DOM, while Angular and Vue update the entire DOM, leading to better performance in React.
- Large community support.
- JSX for easier UI development.
- React Native for mobile app development.

What we need first?
- Node.js (JS runtime environment) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine
- like JVM for java, Node.js is required to run React applications.
- npm is used to install, manage dependencies, and run scripts for React projects.

Library vs framework?
- Library - cool dude, flexible, you call it when you need it.
- Framework - military commander, you follow its rules, it calls you when needed.
- React is a library, Angular and Vue are frameworks.

React folder structure: (What is the structure of a react project?)
    - node_modules/ - installed dependencies (auto-generated, do not modify)
    - public/ - static files (index.html, favicon, etc.)
    - src/ - source code (components, styles, etc.)
    - package.json - project metadata and dependencies
    - package-lock.json - exact versions of installed dependencies (auto-generated, do not modify)
    - .gitignore - files to ignore in version control
    - README.md - project documentation
    - .env - environment variables (optional)

-Studied points:
    -Created app for counter increasing and decreasing.
    
- Hooks
    - It can only be used in functional components, not in class components.
    - not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
    
    - useState - for state management in functional components.
    - before useState count was not reflecting on UI. 
    - useState hook is used to create communication between the state and the UI. It allows us to manage state in functional components.
    - useState returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.
    - Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    - useEffect - for side effects (e.g., data fetching etc)
    - it replaces lifecycle methods in class components (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).

    - useContext - for global state management.
    - Used to share data between components without using props manually at every level.
    - Avoids prop drilling.
    

```

useEffect(() => {
    //if on component mount
    return () => {
        //if on component unmount
    };
  }, [//dependencies]);

//called once when the component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);

//called every time the count changes
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = count;
}, [count]);

//called once when the component unmounts
 useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      console.log("Component unmounted");
      clearInterval(timer);
    };
  }, []);
```
- Commands-
        -npm create vite@latest
        -npm run dev (to run the app)
        -npm run build (to create production build)

- What is redux?
    - It maintains a global state for the application.
    - It has a store for state management.
    - It has actions and reducers to update the state.
    - Helps in managing state in large applications with complex state interactions.

- Higher Order Component (HOC)
    - it is a function that takes a whole component as an agrument and returns a new component with enhanced functionality.
    - Used for code reuse.
